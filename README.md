# NeuralNetworkGA1
Neural Network with Genetic Algorithms Experiment 1 (food and water)

An experiment using Neural Networks and genetic algorithms
I have always found you understand something better if you build it yourself.

See it running at https://youtu.be/yZUhprqGVTE

My aim was to make a "lifeform" that learnt basic needs.  The life form needs water and food to survive.
Water is always available, food is scattered and once eater re-spawns elsewhere.
If the "lifeform" runs out of either then it is classed as "dead"

There are 30 "lifeforms" in each generation, and each generation runs for a maximum of 6000 iterations.
The project is setup with a Neural Network with 8 inputs, two hidden layers and 2 outputs.

With the current configuration and topology, by the 950th generation 2/3 of the lifeforms survive.

I have included data for the network after I left it running over night (it reached 17120 generations)
